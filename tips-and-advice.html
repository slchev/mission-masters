        <div class="col"><em>#1 MISSIONARY PACKAGE ESSENTIAL:</em>

  A good water bottle.
  In case you didn’t send your missionary off with a really good water bottle, I’d say that it’s one of the best gifts that a missionary can receive. Down there it is HOT, and it's usually humid. Being outside for most of the day makes dehydration possibly the leading cause of sickness for missionaries in South America. In some missions, they do receive filtered water bottles when they arrive, but those get gross pretty fast and the missionaries stop using them.</div>
        <div class="col second"><em>#2 MISSIONARY PACKAGE ESSENTIAL:</em>
        Oil-free sunscreen. Like I said before, it is HOT. But not only is it hot, UV rays are WAY stronger than they are here in the US, causing serious skin damage (as you can see in these photos). Sunscreen in South America is EXPENSIVE, possibly too expensive for your missionary to afford with the money they have to use each month. It is also very greasy, and for me personally, it was better to be burned than use the greasy sunscreen and get more zits. Any missionary would be grateful for an oil-free sunscreen.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col"><em>#3 MISSIONARY PACKAGE ESSENTIAL:</em>

        Teeth whiteners. The toothpaste in South America is good enough to prevent cavities, but it doesn’t do a good job whitening. Especially for those missionaries who are returning home in the next 6-8 months, this will brighten their day and their smile!!

</div>



<div class="col second"><em>#4 MISSIONARY PACKAGE ESSENTIAL:</em>
Tide-to-go stain remover. There are ALWAYS accidents in the mission, with dresses and white shirts and messy food, it’s bound to happen. A handy-dandy stain remover that can fit in your backpack or side bag is essential! Unfortunately, they are hard to find in South America and if you can find them, they cost about 10x (without exaggerating) what they cost here.

<div class="col"><em>#5 MISSIONARY PACKAGE ESSENTIAL:</em>

Yummy spices from home. In almost every mission the missionaries prepare their own breakfast, and dinner. Everyday. Sometimes even lunch! No matter how good the food may be where they are serving, some familiar spices or seasonings from mom’s pantry are irresistible!
      </div>
      <div class="col second"><em>#6 MISSIONARY PACKAGE ESSENTIAL:</em>
    New socks. We walk A LOT, and there aren’t readily available very dependable socks. I think enough said.
